-type "setgenerate true" to begin mining (This will max out your cpu. It will not be useful for other tasks.)

-You can type "setgenerate true 2" to use 2 threads of your cpu. You can try increasing the number to find a point where you can multitask on the computer.

-type "setgenerate false" to stop all mining.
